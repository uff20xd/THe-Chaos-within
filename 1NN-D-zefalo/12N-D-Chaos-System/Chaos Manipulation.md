# Mechanics
## What is Chaos?
___
Chaos is the concept on which all realities and possibilities are based on. When manipulated it behaves like a mix between a fluid and a gas.
___
## Chaos Charge
___
REMOVED
___
## Lapse
___
Lapse refers to how many cycles it takes for a technique to be initiated. This is also indirectly connected to efficiency as the output of the technique is divided by the Lapse.

The true mastery over a technique can be seen by a low lapse amount. 
Only the most skilled reach 1-lapse on any technique. 1-lapse is the lowest amount of initiation time that can be reached without the usage of an Orderset.

The 0-lapse:

___

# Basics
## Soul Cycling
___
Soul Cycling is the base to chaos combat. Its the passive ay chaos is pumped through your entire body, amplifying its functions. 
This should be able to be done passively after about 4 - 20 years of training.
This also passively defends your body from changing states though modification Oktae-Branches like [[Aurelius Silva#Midas Curse (Alpha)||Midas Curse]] or [[Viktor Wojci#Concentrated Entropy (Alpha)||Concentrated Entropy]].
Its effectiveness diminishes rather quickly making it so that T1 Ordinants are about the same speed as T2 Ordinants. This can be circumvented by [[#Limit Extension|Limit Extension]].
___
### Cycle Expansion 
___
If the combatant wants to use weapons they use cycle expansion to also take the cycle through the weapon strengthening it.
This will be very inefficient at first but will become better the longer the sword is inside the cycle since the matter needs to adapt first.
This makes the event of having ones sword put out of commission one of the worst things that could happen because it takes about 2 - 3 months to set up a new weapon.
___
## Contracts
___
Contracts can be made between people or with yourself. 
Contracts require a catalyst which is usually a blood seal. They normally are a fair trade giving up one thing for something else. One can lower their durability to multiply their output or increase their speed. They could also set specific rules or limitations so they may use a specific techniques. When a contract between two people is made any rules broken will result in a presupposed penalty. 
___
## Branches
___
Everyone is born with an Oktae in their soul. This Oktae only contains a vague concept as an ability which can be used from birth. Later this Oktae will form branches with their evolved effects.
___

# **Techniques**
## Healing Techniques

## Offensive
### Laceration
___
Creates slashes of chaos. These don't scale that well and wont do big damage to those on your level. Its good to prevent Dimitra and precisely strike weak points.
Invented and commonly used by the fools.
___
### Shak-Hum
___
Puts all chaos into one attack removing all reinforcement of the body.
This stops the soul cycle for some time.
___
### Schwertes Seele
___
By using soul inversion only in the sword part of the soul cycle to increase its damage potential while making it way more unstable. It requires more skill to handle since bad edge alinement would shatter the sword.
___
### Weltenschwert
___
A complete inversion of the soul like a velto oktae but without and imbued Orderset, instead using a sword as its base.
___

## Defensive
### Heal
___
Speeds up the natural healing process OFF THE BODY and stops bleeding.
Its a rather basic technique
___
### Instant Reversal
___
Can reverse all damage even that done to the soul.
Only works on yourself.
Incredibly hard to learn and use.
___
### Lotus WÃ¼ste
___
Is able to partly or completely nullify the effects of Ordersets by disordering them.
All users are part of the fools but its mainly used by Paak and Regen.
___

## Other techniques
### Limit Extension
___
 A technique to push back the cap on the effects of the chaos cycle.
___
### Force Drive
___
 Can only be used on a much weaker soul cycle tghen thte one of the user.
 Forcefully puts someone into Overdrive.
___
## Oktae Specific Techniques
### The Antipotence (Lag Manipulation)
___
A combination of Weltenschwert and Lag manipulation. It no longer slashes and instead applies the corruption effect by overlaying time and then removing the future.
___
### 0-Lapse (True Neutral-Neutrality)
___
It resets the lapse to 0 completely skipping the preperation for the technique used afterwards.
Can alos be used to insta initiate branches but this causes a short circuit doing damage similar do a failed soul inversion.
___

# **Soul Inversion**
## Soul Inversion - Dimitra 
___
Partly inverts the user soul greatly increasing it abilities at the cost of durability.
Depending on how much the soul is inverted a small scratch can explode your hand.
The Soul can only be inverted up to 50% and anything beyond would make the user implode just from natural chaotic ambience.
Sometimes used by people for only a second or so to power up one attack in combination with Shak-Hum.
___
## Soul Inversion - Velto Oktae 
___
Velto Oktae is the true peak of ones own existence and Orderset. Its a way to fully invert the soul in a stable way and fully fuse it with ones Orderset. This works by focusing the chaos in the Orderset while also condensing the soul into a smaller state and also cycling the chaos through all 3 parts of the soul at a RAPID rate. This creates a perfect harmony and with that perfect stability.
This process requires a sign, a name and an incantation.
f.e.:
Hakumeno, Ligro, Fall aus dem nichts, Sign of the Basilisk, Soul Inversion: Velto Oktae - Cycle of life

The Sign decides in what way the Velto Oktae is applied:
Sign of the Phoenix - The Oktae is applied in the user body providing a large stat boost and a maximal version of its effects on the body.

Sign of the Basilisk - The Oktae is applied on Reality itself providing large range boost and a way to always hit the opponent if not prevented through techniques. The Orderset can now affect all of the world around the user.

There are other sign which are specific to a person or a group.
The usage also requires the sign being drawn with one own blood and touch it with you hand while saying the incantation.
The Incantation can be shortened through training and at its max it will look like this.

Velto Oktae - Post Human

This can all be done while artificially creating the sign without blood and preparation.
___

## Countermeasures
### Empty Soul
___
Uses a borderless abstriction created through a contract. This creates a barrier between the inverted soul preventing the Insta-Hit. This barrier can be broken through physical contact making it very unstable. Also prevents the Usage of the Orderset.
___
### Empty Harmony
___
Slightly enlarges the Users soul and creates a harmony without inverting the soul. This grants Immunity to the Insta-Hit. Due to the larger soul it becomes less stable and lowers durability, but the harmony wont break until heavy damage has been taken.
___

# **Abstricions**
## Simple Abstricion
____
A technique that creates a small pocket dimension completely removed from reality. This will leave a core in the actual reality from where outside people may enter the abstricion. After once entering the abstricion its impossible to leave if not allowed by the user. The abstricion will disappear upon the death of the user.
The user can also choose people to forcefully bring into the abstricion as long as they are close to the user and their presence is known to the user.
Simple abstricions are a exact replica of the space around user when created and are made up of 7 Dimensions.
____
## True Abstricion
____
A true abstricion can be largely customised by the user and is now infinite in dimension and completely indestructible.
___
## Semi- Real Abstricion
___
A true abstricion which is based within standard reality while creating an outside barrier. This will draw in other targets in the range the barrier is created around without the user knowing who is around.
The outside barrier does prevent outside entry and if damaged enough the barrier will fall.
___

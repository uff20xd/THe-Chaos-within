**The rules of the universe**
The universe operates on the same rules as ours does. The rules still might slightly stray because of the higher speed of light etc. The universe contains an immeasurable amount of space and spacial and mathematical dimensions.

**The speed of light**
The speed of light in this universe is 1'798'754'748m/s. 

**The gears of time**
Time flows in one unionised Stream including all of existence. Time doesnt slow down the closer one gets to lightspeed and doesnt stop when one surpasses it. When a character becomes infinite in speed they split themselves from this streamlined flow of time and get their own timestream. At that point a character can only become infinite relative to others as the efficiency of chaos dimishes.

**Dimensional Shenanigans**
The spacial dimensions above ethe third are usually empty or inhabited by phantoms. They dont contain any matter at all. 
The body of an ordinant is always 3 dimensional as they have human bodies. This can be changed by specific Ordersets or through true forms. 
The soul of an ordinant can exist in all dimensions at once and can effect all dimension at once. Through chaos the soul cycle can also be extended into as many dimensions as needed.

### Backstory
___
He is the first survivor of the Limit Expansion Experiment of [[Zeivero Nopotami]] to find out how he would need to refine a soul until it can use limit expansion. This would prove to be quite useful as they are excellent soldiers without requiring an Orderset that he cant clone.
LEE-SF-001 turned out to be a failure but because of its very good healing factor he was also used as goon or a human shield.
His body is that of 34 year of male called "Jake Winston" who had his soul stolen around 1928 and got his body turned into what it is now.

# Passive Abilities
## Deathless (Base)
___
Gives the user a strong regeneration factor making it impossible to kill them without destroying every single cell of his body. Also gives a low healing factor to the soul and lets the soul be without body.
This comes at the expense of durability and the fact that his body is continuously in a rather fluid state.

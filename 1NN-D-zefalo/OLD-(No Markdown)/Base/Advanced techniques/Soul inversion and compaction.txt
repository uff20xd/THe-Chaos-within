Soul inversion:
---------------------
Turns your soul outwards making the soul extremly vulnarable but making the user abilities able to use more of their true potential. When you fully use this to 100% anyone (outside zeero) would instantly perish from air pressure because the soul becomes 0% restistant to anything. To truly use your full potential youd need Velto Oktae so you could stabily use soul inversion to it fullest.

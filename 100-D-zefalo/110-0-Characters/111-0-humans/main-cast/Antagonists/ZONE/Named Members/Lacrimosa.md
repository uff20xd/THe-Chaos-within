## Sins of the Crucified (Alpha)
___
Spawns a cross behind every Human with a soul and holes will start to appear on the Victims wrists and neck. This can be defended using a fuck ton of chaos. 
The soul can not go further than 20m away from the cross and as soon as the holes fully manifested they will be forced on the cross and have their Soul instantly erased.

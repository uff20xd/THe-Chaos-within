# Passive Abilities

## Formule (Alpha)
___
The ordinant is able to create a formal: **Decrease/Increase:** *(First the user has to state if he is going to increase the value that is displayed or decrease it if doing the opposite the user will lose the chaos and will gain nothing this has to be said only once for each formal at the beginning)* **minus/plus** *(now the user has to state if the number he wants to add/subtract/divide with… is negative or positive)* **subtraction/addition/division…** *(The ordinant has to say what he is going to do subtract or divide and so on)* **6** *(The number that is being used this can be continued for example if we had a punch with the speed of 100 -Decrease: minus division 2 minus subtraction 5 plus multiplication 2- this would equal a speed of -60 afterwards)*

IMPORTANT: 
1)
if the user uses minus addition or plus subtraction nothing will happen and chaos used will be used up.
2)
Changing any value has a cooldown that's why formal is better than just using the active abilities separately because the value decreased or increased can be far greater 
3)
formal = formula
___

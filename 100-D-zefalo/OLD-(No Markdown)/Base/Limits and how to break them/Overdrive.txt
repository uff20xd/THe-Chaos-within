When an ordinant tries to use more power than their output, intake or storage allows they may enter Overdrive. The chance enlargens the more power is used than is accessible.

During Overdrive the Ordinants Body and his soul are overtaken by the chaos causing its Order sets to go rogue. When the soul is not strong enough it will be overwritten by the chaos killing the souls owner.
Then the Ordinants overtaken functions will go rogue attacking anyone around him. This process dissregards the user own body, dmaging  it during ist rampage. Should the rampaging soul run out of chaos it will start to use itself and its body as a chaos source dissolving both.


There are two other ways to cause Overdrive:

Kaptico:
A drug that upon taking it instantly triggers overdrive.

Techniques of the Fool-forced Overload:
Upon touching an object that contains a soul, energy is forced into the soul triggering Overdrive.

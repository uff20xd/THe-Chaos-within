Techniques developed by faction of scientist specialised in chaos research called the fools. 
--> For more information look for "the fools" in the groups folder.

Empty harmony:
---------------------
Creates a incomplete harmony using an abtrition around the user body as its base. This makes the soul about half as stable as it would be when an average Velto Oktae is and defends way better against against the usual onehsot of a soul by a velto oktae then Empty souls does and makes for a faster switch between offense and defense. It use Doesnt use soul inversion but can be combined with function like proven by paacke even though its very hard and he was the only one to pull it of as the technique was only 2 weeks old when shown by zeero in his last fight.
---------------------

Reversal-Anti Harmony:
---------------------
By reversing the previous technique you create a negative harmony which makes the oppnents harmony less effective in defending making actual direct damage to the soul possible. Doesnt directly affect the soul of the opponent but only its harmony making it useless on non Velto Oktae opponents.
---------------------
 
Limit extension:
---------------------
One of the more well known abilities of the member of the fools which is known by outside people aswell. It extends limits or rule and effects outwards. Its used for high speed travel since you can easily multiply your speed, while not having detructive effects on objects like lightspeed would have. It costs a fuck lot of chaos and can only be used by the mathematician and all members of the T0 except the game addict.
---------------------

Overclock:
---------------------
By shortcircuiting your soul ccu and function base while temprarily cutting of your consciessness from your soul you achieve a stabel and controlled overdrive. Eventhough you may controll your body the massive amounts of chaos may still permanently damagve your soul.
---------------------

Overdone:
---------------------
By using the shortcircuiting part on a weak other soul you can force overdrive onto it which will then kill it.
---------------------

Paack stance:
---------------------
The first complete technique develpoed by paack, the strongest functionless ordinant and a genius in all things chaos. A technique which denses chaos around the user to an insnae degree higher all physiacal stats at the cost of soul protection. It requires a high mastery in exertion technique and also probaby an Exertion affinity.
---------------------

Laceration:
---------------------
By manifesting a dense chaos slash only directly before it would hit an opponent making it near impossible to dodge. Also invented by paack and has similar requirements to paack stance.

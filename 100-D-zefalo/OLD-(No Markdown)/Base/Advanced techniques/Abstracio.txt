A dimirror is a technique to create a mirror of reality. One can choos who or what gets transported there. This ISNT a way to trap someone or get a fair 1v1, because as soon as you no longer are inside the dimirror it vanishes and it can be entered from the outside by going through the mirror cor left behind by the peron who used the dimirror. 


Simple Dimirror:
---------------------
Mirrors the first 3 dimensions reality without anything special. This isnt a universal feat since it doesnt actually create universe but just mirrors one. Can be extended to 5 dimensions with training.
---------------------

Abstract Dimirror / Signum:
---------------------
Still takes the bases of our reality but modifies it and can have far more dimensions than a simple one. Way harder to do than the simple one and is usually only used by advanced oridnants.
---------------------

Abstricio:
--------------------- 
Creates a completly new reality with custom rules etc. These can be more stable than actuall reality. These can be umbued with a function to cause effects.

# What is a non-chaotic space?

# Creation
## Heaven
### Artificial Heaven
___
The creation of an artificial Heaven is a rather complicated Process originally proposed by [[Zeero]] and later completed by [[Zeivero Nopotami]].
It requires 4 base components.

**The Smith**:
A person with ability too fuse souls together. This person is the most important part and requires an enormous mastery over their abilities and probably also a contract which increases abilities based on certain circumstances like the one made by Zeivero to lock away 80% of his abilities until the solar eclipse to increase the abilities potency in just that time.

**The Base Soul:**
Soul with an Orderset which will serve as the key to the heaven which will be planted in their soul.
Different types of Ordersets have a different affinity to be a key and let the soul inhabit a Heaven in this Order (descending):
1. Imaginative
2. Manipulation
3. Exertion
4. Empowerment
5. Modification
A combination of two of them will be slightly better than one of them on their own but it varies based on the Soul and Orderset. The best possible combination would be Manipulation + Imaginative.

**The Connection:**
Another Orderset at least sharing one type with the base soul. This ability needs to be somewhat developed but is the only part that doesn't require a contract with the soul.

**Time and Positioning:**
This Ritual requires a total solar eclipse and the smith and base soul to be on the opposite side of the earth all in a straight line up with the solar eclipse. The abilities of the smith will seem to fade as soon as the solar eclipse begins if everything goes well.
Also both smith and base need to invert their soul as soon as the total eclipse starts.
___
### Natural Heaven
___
A natural Heaven can be formed through the perfection of ones soul and then total sacrifice of a heavenly Orderset into a Heaven.
___

## Enigma
___
An Enigma can be formed by perfecting ones soul and then total sacrifice of a Void Orderset into a Enigma.
___

# The Truth
___
The Truth is the absolute pinnacle of ability. It grants the user absolute true omnipotence.
This takes a soul which was turned into a Heaven or Enigma and then absorbed the other one.
Then the user needs to maximise its capabilities until he can escape the chaos bubble. 
Afterwards he needs to absorb the chaos bubble and take its place as the Chaotic Convergence which will act at as the catalyser to turn the soul into the Truth.

The Chaos Singularity is singular point of chaos which contains all of possible and impossible fiction. This chaos singularity is surrounded by the Antithetic Inverted Singularity - Void. There nothing else.
Within the chaos singularity you find chaos bubbles which contain anything. 
The centre of the singularity is the Chaos Convergence where all possibilities converge into one which brought forth Ordersets and chaos manipulation.
Chaos bubbles are always as stable as everything inside it. This means that no matter how powerful anything inside is it will never leave the bubble since to them the outside doesn't exist. To everyone inside a chaos bubble everything outside of it is fiction.
The only thing that can leave these bubbles is a mature enough [[Non-chaotic spaces and the Truth#Creation|Non-chaotic space]].
The chaos convergence can be used as a catalyst to make contracts without any loss and to create [[Non-chaotic spaces and the Truth#The Truth|The Truth]].

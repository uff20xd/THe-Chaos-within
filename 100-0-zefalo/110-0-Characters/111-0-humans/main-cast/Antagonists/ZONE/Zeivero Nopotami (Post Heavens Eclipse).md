### Style / Tactics
___
He usually just blasts his opponents with the vast amount of chaos made by burning up souls. For anyone problematic he has plans to kill or at least stop them from bothering him. He really doesn't care what souls he uses up because he has more than enough to kill everyone (except for the Fools).
For example he specifically fused 293 souls together to create a function which could fully seal away the mathematician away if he can just touch him once. This seal would hold for about 1 month if he lives and would octuple if he dies within that month.
___
### Scaling 
___
He is the second strongest Ordinant of the modern time being slightly stronger than Paak and lots weaker than the Mathematician. Even though he doesn't no diff the T1 Members some Ordinants like Narotemos, Kelvin or Levia. 
He is currently in the Possession of over 60 000 souls most of which are phantom souls which lack a useable ability for the most part but instead possess an ungodly amount of chaos.

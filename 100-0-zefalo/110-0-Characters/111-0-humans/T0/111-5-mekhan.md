### Style / Tactics
___
Normally starts with ring seven's weapon to find out his opponents abilities since its the most versatile without costing loads of chaos to manifest.
Then he chooses a weapon depending on the opponent. He usually skips ring 3 since he hates the large sword fractal and much prefers the handy spear of ring 6, the changeable weapon of ring 7 or the short sword "clover" of ring 1.
When up against anything decent he is forced to use atomoss or clover.
___
### Scaling 
___
Second lowest destructivity but is able semi keep up with Zeero by maxing out the luck capabilities of Clover and is a bit of a threat since he can damage him and at least slow him down using luck, but he gets out scaled when it come to 1v1 fights by the other T0s.
